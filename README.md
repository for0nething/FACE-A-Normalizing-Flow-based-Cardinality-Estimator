# FACE
This is a pytorch implementation for the VLDB 2022 paper [FACE: A Normalizing Flow based Cardinality Estimator](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p72-li.pdf) [[**Citation**]](#citation).
Our codes are built based on [nflows](https://pypi.org/project/nflows/) and [torchquad](https://github.com/esa/torchquad).

# Quick Start
The real-world datasets can be downloaded from [dataset link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16b-yaSYK6l6ZclLkP6rIxxUyye5Iockm?usp=sharing).
We use power and BJAQ as concrete examples to illustrate how to use FACE for cardinality estimation.
- **Step 1:** Build conda environment with `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
- **Step 2:** Switch to the installed environment by `conda activate testenv`.
- **Step 3:** Install modified torchquad by `cd ./torchquadMy`, and then `pip install .` .
- **Step 4:** Download the datasets from [dataset link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16b-yaSYK6l6ZclLkP6rIxxUyye5Iockm?usp=sharing), and then place the data into `data` directory.
- **Step 5:** After properly setting the paths of datasets, models, etc, 
you can use the notebook files under `train` and `evaluate` directories to conduct experiments.





**Notes:** 
- Before running the codes, make sure the path variable `PROJECT_PATH` is set properly. 
This variable should be set as the path of the project root directory.
- Current codes may be incompatible with machines that do not have GPUs.
- For GPUs with memory less than 2080Ti (11GB),
 some parameters need to be set smaller, which will bring some performance loss.
